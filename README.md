# README

The purpose of this repo is to get my enviroPlus hat for the Raspberry Pi collecting data and sending it to Azure IOT Central for visualisation and analysis purposes. 

I'll be following the instructions [from this post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/internet-of-things/build-an-air-pollution-monitor-with-a-raspberry-pi-a-particulate/ba-p/1542844) and making some adjustments along the way given that I don't have an air quality sensor.
